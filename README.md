# passive-toolchanger
A concept for 3d printer toolchanger which uses only the existing X- and Y-movements to lock and unlock the toolhead

## What is passive-toolchanger?
This project was inspired by existing toolchangers. They all used additional hardware to lock and unlock the tool.
This is usually done by a motor that rotates a lock or by an electromagnet. \
I wanted to find a way to lock and unlock the toolhead with the allready existing stepper motors for the X- and Y-movement.

I am not sure if this has any benefit, but somehow it became a personal challenge.
All what I am publishing here is only "proof of concept" because I do not have a printer that can be transfered to a toolchanger yet.
